# Hierarchical_bayesian_prediction
This project uses a Hierarchical Bayesian Model to predict propane consumption across multiple tanks in different regions. The model incorporates several features, such as tank level, temperature, and usage rate, and accounts for differences between regions using group-level effects. The model is implemented using PyMC3 and utilizes MCMC sampling.
